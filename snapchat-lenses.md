I have been playing around with [Lens Studio](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/ "Snapchat Lens Studio"), an augmented reality development software used to create content for Snapchat. My work with Augmented Reality using Lens Studio includes Lightroom Classic preset, Facial Tracking, and Face Expression & More. I want to create abstract lenses to enable viewers to use my work as a tool to experience my point of view and also fulfill the need to create and share more lenses.

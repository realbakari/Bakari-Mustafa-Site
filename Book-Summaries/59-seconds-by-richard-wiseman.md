## The Five Big Ideas

1. “When people can afford the necessities in life, an increase in income does not result in a significantly happier life”.
2. “To encourage people to do more of something they enjoy, try presenting them with the occasional small surprise reward after they have completed the activity, or praise the fruits of their labour”.
3. “To increase the likelihood of someone liking you, get them to do you a favour”.
4. “Fantasizing about your perfect world may make you feel better but is unlikely to help transform your dreams into reality”.
5. “Some research suggests that eating more slowly helps people eat less, perhaps because it fools our brains into thinking that we’ve eaten more, and allows extra time for the body to digest food”.

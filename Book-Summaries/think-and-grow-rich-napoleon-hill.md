# Think and Grow Rich Review

[Napoleon Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Hill)‘s [_Think and Grow Rich_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1503081036?tag=whywhathow-20) (1938) is [the best-selling non-fiction book of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_books).

### Think and Grow Rich Summary

[The subconscious mind is the seat of creativity](https://bakarimustafa.com/book-summaries/a-mind-for-numbers-summary-barbara-oakley) and a tireless servant of the body. Normally, the subconscious is busy keeping us alive and fulfilling [‘basic’ needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs). But it is possible to consciously tap into the subconscious mind – to direct it and use it to achieve any aim. This principle, its application and its rewards are at the heart of _Think and Grow Rich_.

The main bottleneck between the conscious and subconscious is communication. Conscious-subconscious communication _is_ constant. But _success_ lies in developing this dialogue actively in both directions. First, the conscious must use [_autosuggestion_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosuggestion) to _engage_ the subconscious and _direct_ it in a language it understands. Then, the conscious must learn to [_step back_, _listen_ and _support_](https://theartofliving.com/think-and-grow-rich-summary/#support) the subconscious as it works.

### Engaging the Subconscious

To engage our subconscious, we must learn to use _strong emotional states_ to soften and make it [suggestible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggestibility). To master those states we must first learn to [_create_](https://theartofliving.com/think-and-grow-rich-summary/#create) them or [_hijack_](https://theartofliving.com/think-and-grow-rich-summary/#hijack) them.

#### **Creating Emotional States**

[Emotional states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_state) and [emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion) are two different things. An emotional state is a light whose intensity varies from very bright to very dull. Emotions are colour filters that alter that light. They twist and tint all that it shines on. Major [positive emotions](https://designepiclife.com/list-of-emotions/) include [desire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire), [belief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief), [love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love), [sex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_arousal), [enthusiasm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthusiasm), [romance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)) and [hope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope). Major negative emotions include [fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear), [jealousy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jealousy), [hatred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatred), [revenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge), [greed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greed), [superstition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstition) and [anger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anger).

One way to _create_ strong emotional states (i.e., passion) is to consciously trigger strong emotions (e.g., happiness, faith, fear). It doesn’t matter if the trigger is external (e.g., events, images, objects, music) or internal (e.g., memories, [affirmation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmations_(New_Age)), prayer, [visualisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_visualization)). You just need to know what they are and how to find them. For example, to foster happiness, you might talk with a person you like. To foster faith, you might repeat affirmations (“I can do it, I can do it, I can do it”) until conviction (“I _can_ do it”) becomes emotion (i.e., belief).

We can also create emotional states _without_ emotional triggers. We do this by altering our _physical_ state and letting the _emotional_ state follow. Common physical triggers include meditation, fasting, fatigue, stress, alcohol and drugs. The catch? Such triggers can be harmful and their states rarely stay neutral for long. Without mastery, loss of control is common and can come at a catastrophic cost that is not always ours alone to pay.

#### **Hijacking Emotional States**

How can we master strong emotional states once they’ve arisen? The answer is in learning to _hijack_ them through _substitution_ and _sublimation_.

The first way to _hijack_ existing emotional states is _substitution._ In _substitution_, we maintain an emotional state’s brightness while we alter its colour at will. How? By focussing intently on triggers that elicit a different, desired response. For example, we can parry passionate anger with a focus on objects of love. _Substitution_ is most effective when a new emotion subverts the source of an old one (e.g., by smothering a cycle of hatred). It can otherwise verge on [suppression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressive_suppression), which is a draining and unsustainable coping strategy.

The second way to _hijack_ existing emotional states is _sublimation._ In _sublimation_ we maintain brightness _and_ colour but alter the focus of action. With practice, we can learn to channel any emotion – from sex and desire to anger – into any action – from work and athletics to art. Like _substitution_, _sublimation_ requires mastery of focus. First, we must override an emotion’s tendency to preserve and to focus on itself. Next, we must direct that energy externally. Finally, we must learn to refresh that energy by shifting repeatedly between trigger and target.

#### **Emotional Mastery**

_Substitution_ and _sublimation_ are especially effective together. An emotion’s nature subtly yet fundamentally alters the nature of perception and action. That’s why negative emotions, though powerful, tend to have negative effects on ourselves and the world around us. The most effective short-term approach to negative emotions is to _substitute_ _then_ _sublimate_. Doing so lets us consistently channel positive emotions into constructive outcomes.

Mastering _creation_, _substitution_ and _sublimation_ is the essence of _emotional mastery_. And emotional mastery is critical because it allows us to soften the subconscious and make it [suggestible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggestibility) at will.

Why is that important? Because with the subconscious softened and suggestible, it’s time to deliver a message.

### Directing the Subconscious

We use [_visualisation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_visualization) to talk to the subconscious in a language it understands – sensation. _Visualisation_ means _imagining_ events and outcomes _so realistically_ that we can _feel_ them. Think [hallucinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination), [mirages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage) and [lucid dreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream). That’s the realism we’re aiming for.

Though visualisation is a common technique in meditation and performance psychology, most of us are surprisingly bad at it. The good news is we can all improve, quickly, with practice, practice, practice.

#### **An Exercise in Visualisation**

Go somewhere quiet, close your eyes, set a timer for one minute. Imagine a place you know well that is filled with fond memories. Don’t push yourself too hard, let the space materialise and expand in your mind. As it does, explore it, walk around it, notice the objects in their places, look at the area from different places and angles.

Was the exercise easy or difficult? Did you force the visualisation or let it unfold on its own? What did you see? What did you feel?

Perhaps that was tough. Perhaps all you got was a rough sensation. Perhaps one minute felt like a long time to stay focused. But practise this every day I promise you your visualisation will become clearer, richer and deeper. You’ll begin filling in details, seeing colours and patterns, remembering textures and sensations. As your focus improves you’ll be able to maintain that visualisation for longer and longer.

#### **Visualising Abstract Concepts**

The keys to visualisation are clarity, detail, and repetition. But that’s harder for abstract or imagined concepts like goals and objectives. One way to overcome this is to [fix a clear description of those outcomes in writing](http://www.psitek.net/pages/PsiTekTAGR11.html). This process is not about the words. It’s about the images and sensations those words create. It’s about making those sensations repeatable.

When a talented author writes, the words disappear. You see places and characters, you hear them, you sense them, you _feel_ them. That’s the outcome you want when you write down and visualise a goal, you want specificity, clarity and consistency. When you read the words aloud, you want to see their outcome, to touch it, to _feel_ it. Feel your desire for that goal heighten your emotional state. Repeat the process again and again until you brand the image in your subconscious.

When you read [Hill’s central six-step processes](http://www.psitek.net/pages/PsiTekTAGR5.html) yourself, you’ll see he hits all of these points. He asks us to write a _clear_ vision of _exactly_ what wealth we want to acquire. He asks us to see and feel ourselves in possession of the money, to run the bills over our fingers, to smell the notes in our hands. He asks us to create a strong emotional state by building an intense and burning desire. THAT is visualisation, that is the route to our subconscious.

#### **Engagement + Direction = Autosuggestion**

Combining visualisation with emotional states primes us. It puts the subconscious to work. It directs a subconscious that sees and acts with a subtlety our conscious mind can’t emulate. A subconscious that thinks in a way that’s non-linear and creative. A subconscious that works on our problems 24/7, [even as we sleep](https://theartofliving.com/why-we-sleep-summary/). This combination of _emotional mastery_ and _visualisation_ is the essence of _autosuggestion._

But substitute _our_ subconscious mind with the subconscious minds of _other people_ and it’s also the essence of [_persuasion_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persuasion)_._ Substitute our subconscious mind with _an organisation_ and our conscious mind with its _leader_ and it’s also the essence of [_leadership_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership)_._

Think about it. Why are some advertisers, organisations and leaders so effective? Because they know how to manipulate, substitute and sublimate emotions. Because they know how to plant ideas in our minds that get us working on tasks of their choosing.

This half-humbling, half-liberating insight is at the heart of _Think and Grow Rich_‘s power.

### Setting the Subconscious up for Success

So with the subconscious engaged and directed, what’s next? The answer, explains Hill is to _get out of its way and support it_.

There are seven ways the conscious mind can set the subconscious up for success:

1. **STEPPING BACK** – Stepping back from the pointless chatter of the mind lets us work _on_ our problems rather than _in_ them. It gives the subconscious time and space to work. It lets us intervene judiciously, without being sucked into the chaos. It’s also essential for…
2. **LISTENING** – The subconscious tells the conscious what it needs and thinks with [emotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion) and [inspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_inspiration). To understand what it’s saying we must listen.
   * To listen to emotion, listen to your body. What is that tension, heaviness or lightness telling you? Now _address it_, _don’t_ suppress it. If your thoughts and emotions are in conflict, your emotions are usually right.
   * To listen to inspiration, be _quiet_ and be _patient_. Respect and record “Aha!” moments. Recreate the conditions that create them. They are gifts from your subconscious and an important ingredient in…
3. **PROBLEM-SOLVING** – The conscious mind is excellent at organising and re-organising information in sequences and stories. It’s especially well suited to working with timing and relationships in activities like planning. One of the most important problems we use the conscious mind to solve is…
4. **LEARNING** – The conscious and subconscious both use and are bounded by knowledge. The subconscious learns effectively from sensation and emotion. The conscious gathers information coded in language and stored in stories and facts. This second type of knowledge is essential. It lets us learn vicariously, transcending the boundaries of personal experience.
5. **TRAINING** – “We are what we repeatedly do” and the subconscious repeatedly does what is habit. The conscious breaks habits by repeatedly intervening in the gap between stimulus and response until a new pattern is trained. This intervention takes self-awareness, imagination and will-power. For more, try these crunches on [The Power of Habit](https://theartofliving.com/the-power-of-habit-by-charles-duhigg/) or [The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People](https://theartofliving.com/the-7-habits-of-highly-effective-people-summary/).
6. **REASSURING** – Of all the negative emotions, none rules our subconscious like fear. According to Hill, we mainly fear poverty, criticism, ill-health, loss of love, old age and death. The conscious mind reassures the subconscious, conquering fear through _acceptance_, _belief_ and _action_: “‘Do the thing you fear and the death of fear is certain.”
7. **PROTECTING** – Our conscious constantly competes for emotional and subconscious control. Some external influencers are positive, others negative. To protect the subconscious, the conscious mind must understand when and how the subconscious becomes vulnerable. To protect its control, it must then counter negative influences and eliminate their sources from the environment.

By far the most important point in this list is the first. Supporting our subconscious starts with listening. Listening to our subconscious starts with stepping back. You may find that difficult. You may not even know what that feels like. Don’t worry. Learning when and how to step back is a lifetime of work in itself. For more, I’d strongly recommend starting with [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) or [_The Power of Now_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1577314808/?tag=whywhathow-20).

For everything else, there is more than enough to get started with in Hill’s multitude of step-by-step guides, checklists and inventories…

### The Think and Grow Rich Methodology

_Think and Grow Rich_ is the best selling non-fiction book of all time because, “people buy titles, and not the contents of books”. In Hill’s own words: “The major reason why I wrote this book on how to get money is the fact that the world has but lately passed through [an experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression) that left millions of men and women paralysed with the fear of poverty.”

Fortunately, _Think and Grow Rich_ delivers on both title and contents. Its methods are clear, simple and directed at financial gain. And yet, with a grasp of the principles underneath they can be easily applied to any outcome we choose.

#### 10 Steps to Financial Success

Hill’s full approach to financial success can be summarised in 10 steps:

 1. **Decide on a definite purpose.** Write down exactly how much money you want, by when. Make it clear, specific and tangible.
 2. **Embed it in your subconscious.** Visualise this goal twice daily as if it were already a reality. Fan the flames of a burning desire to acquire it.
 3. **Have faith.** Develop self-confidence, eliminate fear and trust in your ability to get what you want by applying the principles above.
 4. **Make a plan.** Write a plan of action, get started right away (whether you feel ready or not) and develop your plan over time.
 5. **Learn what you need.** Identify the specific knowledge you need to make your plan a success. Learn it yourself or surround yourself with people who have it.
 6. **Gather support.** Put together a Master Mind group of like-minded people to sympathise, cooperate and share knowledge with.
 7. **Get help from others.** Meet with your Master Mind group often and maintain perfect harmony within it.
 8. **Set your subconscious up for success**. Step back, listen, support and guard your subconscious as it works.
 9. **Work on your character.** Develop self-control, focus and a character and habits that align naturally with your desired outcome.
10. **Never give up.** There is no such thing as failure. Look for the opportunity in every setback and remember: “Winners never quit and quitters never win.”

The book is detailed and directive on each of these points. I wouldn’t have much to add or remove beyond copying and pasting Hill’s own writing here.

Instead of that, I’d suggest checking out Hill’s original text over at [PsiTek](http://www.psitek.net/) as linked to in the relevant sections below. The how-to and introspection resources and the [8 Causes of Persistence](http://www.psitek.net/pages/PsiTekTAGR24.html) are particularly worthwhile reviewing.

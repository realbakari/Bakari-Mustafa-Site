I create amazing augmented reality experiences using [Effect House](https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/)! This includes branded selfie effects, AR game effects, and even the latest randomizer AR effects. Let me amplify your TikTok engagement for your next social media marketing campaign.

TikTok is one of the most popular social networks in the world, with over 600 million monthly active users. It is the most downloaded app in the world, and 41% of its users are between the ages of 16 and 24.

The aim of this app is to create short videos, and TikTok does not want to limit the ideas of creators. This allows brands to create content that reflects their image on the most popular social network for young people.

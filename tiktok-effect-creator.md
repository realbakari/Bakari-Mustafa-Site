I create amazing AR experiences using [Effect House](https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/)! Everything from your branded selfie effects, AR game effects, or even the latest randomizer AR effects. Let me amplify your TikTok engagement for your next social media marketing campaign.

TikTok is one of the most widely used social networks in the world with over 600 million monthly active users. It is the most downloaded application in the world and 41% of users are between 16 and 24 years old.

The aim of this application is to create short videos and TikTok does not want to limit the ideas of creators. This allows brands to create content that reflects their image on the most popular social network for young people.

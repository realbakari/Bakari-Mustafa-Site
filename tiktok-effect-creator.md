TikTok is one of the most widely used social networks in the world with over 600 million monthly active users. It is the most downloaded application in the world and 41% of users are between 16 and 24 years old.

The aim of this application is to create short videos and TikTok does not want to limit the ideas of creators. This allows brands to create content that reflects their image on the most popular social network for young people.

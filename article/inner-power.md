Intuition defined as “into the soul” is a natural gift we are all born with. It’s an inner guide, gut feeling, or sixth sense. It interacts with us on a daily basis with every experience from making a major life decision to deciding what product is better to purchase.

Have you walked into a bookstore and felt drawn to a book for no reason? You check it out and realize it’s exactly the type of book you need at this moment in your life? Or met someone and instantly felt a connection? This is your intuition guiding you to people, places, and experiences meant for your soul’s growth and expansion. Intuition helps us avoid specific situations, people, and decisions. For example, going on a date for the first time and getting a bad vibe about the person. That “bad vibe” is you sensing that person’s energy. Perhaps later you find out why you didn’t get the greatest feeling about the person.

We receive good and bad vibes all day in our work environments, personal relationships, family, health matters, and more. Intuitive impressions help us with major life decisions and also prepare and inform of us things to come or things that have passed.

While people often talk about consciousness, it can be somewhat difficult to define. Consciousness refers to your individual awareness of your unique thoughts, memories, feelings, sensations, and environment. Your consciousness is your awareness of yourself and the world around you. This awareness is subjective and unique to you. Your conscious experiences are constantly shifting and changing. For example, in one moment you may be focused on reading this article. Your consciousness may then shift to the memory of a conversation you had earlier with a co-worker. Next, you might notice how uncomfortable your chair is, or maybe you are mentally planning dinner.

This ever-shifting stream of thoughts can change dramatically from one moment to the next, but your experience of it seems smooth and effortless.

### **Energy sensing**

Energy sensing is a simple technique and one you can practice with yourself. Get into a calm meditative state. When you feel relaxed, bring your awareness to your heart center. Notice how your heart feels. Pay attention to any feelings, colors, blockages that may arise. You can practice this with other chakra centers as well.

Meditation is a true technique to tap into your inner wisdom and communicate with your higher self. It not only helps with stress relief but also opens the door to your intuition. A simple meditation technique is concentrating on your breath for 5 minutes or repeating a mantra such as “Om Shanti,” which means inner peace in your mind. If you lack focus and concentration while being still, I suggest doing a walking meditation like walking in the park and taking in the sounds and smells of the season. You can also create, write, or do anything that brings peace and stillness to your mind.

Begin to notice repeating signs, symbols, or numbers in your environment. This may be a message from the universe, or your intuition guiding you, or showing you something. You can interpret the sign as what you feel it may mean. Also, notice how you feel or what you are thinking about when you see the sign as a potential way to interpret it.

Set aside time each day for 10-15 minutes to turn off all electronics, check out from life, and tune into yourself. During this time, notice how you feel emotionally, mentally, and spiritually. You can ask questions about a particular concern such as “Is this career transition right for me?” Notice what feelings, emotions, or impressions arise. Write down what you experienced and practice this throughout the week at the end of your day.

In our dream state, we are open and highly receptive to connecting with our intuition. Start to keep a dream journal and take notes, Pay attention to recurring themes, symbols, or feelings you experience in them.

Also, concentrate on a concern or question at night before you go to bed. The next morning write down what you received if anything. Be patient as this exercise doesn’t always work immediately. You may also want to get some crystals for dreaming to help enhance your connection.

### **Spirit Guides**

Your guides are always there. They are always supporting you. But they cannot come in unless you ask. They can’t come in without your free will — unless you’re in a life-threatening situation, in which case a guide can come in without you asking.

If you’re new to the practice, then writing is a fantastic way to connect. After your meditation, write at the top of the page: _Thank you, guides of the highest truth and compassion, for showing me right I need to know._ Let your pen flow. Let whatever needs to come through, come through – ideas, stories, topics, inspired visions, things you may not have thought of on your own, will start to come through.

Another way is to ask your guides for a sign. _“If I’m on the right track, show me…”_ and choose a sign. Asking the guides to show you a sign will be a clear moment of recognizing they’re with you and supporting you.

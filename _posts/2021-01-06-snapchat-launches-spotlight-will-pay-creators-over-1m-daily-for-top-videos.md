Snapchat has announced that Spotlight will follow its traditional rules regarding privacy and safety. It will be moderated, not allow public comments, and profiles are private by default. All Snaps submitted will have to adhere to content guidelines in order to receive a distribution.

Over time the Snaps curated on Spotlight will be tailored to each Snapchatter using the site. It is currently accessible to users in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, and France, with other countries slated to join soon.

To appear on Spotlight, all posts must comply with [Snap’s Community Guidelines](https://www.snap.com/en-US/community-guidelines) and the company said human moderators will monitor Spotlight content for policy violations. Among other things, the guidelines prohibit posting of false information (including conspiracy theories), misleading content, hate speech, explicit or profane content, bullying, harassment, and violence.

### Tips for succeeding on Spotlight:

* **Hashtags are critical.** We recommend loading up the content with as many relevant hashtags as possible. You can currently add up to 100 hashtags on a Spotlight submission, but it’s not recommended to go overboard. Videos submitted with unrelated hashtags have a higher chance of being rejected.
* **Use native Snapchat features.** Native Snapchat text added to the video most likely provides additional context for the video in the Spotlight algorithm. Most videos you come across in the Spotlight feed have Snapchat text added or other native Snapchat features.
* **Don’t overdo it.** Viral moments captured on camera and creative content creators are going to have an advantage here. Content that is overproduced does not seem to be featured prominently in the Spotlight feed.
* **Don’t disqualify yourself.** Content moderation is real. Nothing with outside music, copyrighted footage, TikTok logos, Instagram fonts, Boomerangs, or identifiable Superzoom effects will be accepted. If it is easily identifiable as content made for another platform, it will most likely get rejected.
* **Don’t give up.** While Snapchat limits how frequently you can submit there does not appear to be a penalty for how many Snaps you submit to Spotlight.

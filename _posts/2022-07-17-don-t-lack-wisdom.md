> If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.“

Ask big things from God.

Here, James tells us to ask the Lord for wisdom if we need it. However, don’t let any man ask for something from God and think he will receive anything from Him unless that man trusts in the Lord and has faith in the Lord to give it. So, are you asking for big things and believing that the Lord’s will be done?

Asking God for big things is not demanding things out of the lusts we have for those things. In fact, James goes on to say in James 4:3, “You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.” What is your motive and objective when you approach the Lord?

When you approach God, ask what you will - according to His plan and will, in faith - and do not waver. A wavering person is tossed to and from and does not trust. They are double-minded and unstable. So, ask in faith and be steady, strong, and unwavering.

Ask God for the salvation of your children and don’t waver. Ask God for a resolution in a relationship and do not fail to place your trust in God. Ask the Lord for refilling of His Spirit in your soul and believe that He will do it.

Whatever you ask in faith, ask big.

#### 60-0729 - "What It Takes To Overcome All Unbelief: Our Faith"

"You have not because you ask not. You ask not because you believe not. Ask abundantly that your joys might be full." That's what God wants: Ask big things. I'm asking for hundreds of souls in this meeting. I'm asking that every sick person enters that door will go out of here well. I'm believing it. I'm believing that till we go, that this won't be another gathering together, but it'll be a revival in Yakima here. Satan's kept me out of here long enough, and I believe the hour is here for a real sweeping revival in every church and around the country.

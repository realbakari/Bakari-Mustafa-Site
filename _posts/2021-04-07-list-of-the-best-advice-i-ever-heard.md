* When it comes to personal growth and development, you have to make the most of the time you have left on this planet. So if you do not have enough time, find a few good friends, spend time with them, and do things that make you happy. 
* Take chances. Failure is not the end of the world, it’s a stepping stone. Everyone gets rejected or rejected. That’s part of the journey. The idea that failure is death makes you a failure. The idea that failure is the road to success makes you a winner.
* "There is no room for fear. I think that's the scariest place." 
* "Now is the time to lead." 
* "You were given this second chance to do everything in your power to make good choices." 
* "As many disappointments as you may have, you have an entire new lifetime of achievements ahead of you." 
* "Asking how they are doing, not about what they are doing is the way to connect."
* Do everything you possibly can for your career while you are young before you settle down and have kids. 
* Don't ever take yourself, or your job too seriously. Laugh often. It's good for you.
* You are only as old as you feel. And if you still feel young, you're probably only old in your heart.
* Don’t set a time limit on how long you want to be with someone. Take it as long as you want. Don’t expect him/her to feel the same way you do. You should never have to force a relationship. Be yourself, let yourself open up and they will feel the same way.
* Tell them about your problems. 
* Love yourself. You are the only person who can make you happy. It’s a way of life, never say never. Do what makes you happy and try to find a way to make it work.
* Never underestimate your ability to dream. 
*  There is no such thing as luck. You create your own luck. 
*  Learn from the mistakes of others, but always make your own. 
* Do all you can to enjoy your job. 
*  If you wake up each day and love what you do, you will never have to search for motivation. 
*  It’s your attitude and determination that make all the difference. 
* Don’t focus on what other people think of you. 
* You have no limits.

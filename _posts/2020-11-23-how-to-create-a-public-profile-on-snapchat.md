Public profiles on Snapchat aren’t exactly new, but they were previously limited to verified creators. You could consume all kinds of content on Snapchat, but it was all coming from celebrities, digital stars, brands, and the creators of Snapchat Lenses. Now, anyone can have a public profile and try to build out an audience on Snapchat.

#### Here’s how to get a public profile on Snapchat.

Snapchatters 18 and older can now opt in to having a Public Profile if they want to share a little more about themselves with a wider audience (beyond their immediate friends). Learn more about [Public Profiles](https://support.snapchat.com/a/about-profiles).

It doesn’t matter if you have a genius IQ and a Ph.D. in Whatever major you did or maybe doing, you can’t change anything or make any sort of real-world progress without taking action. There’s a huge difference between knowing how to do something and actually doing it. Knowledge and intelligence are both useless without action. It’s as simple as that.

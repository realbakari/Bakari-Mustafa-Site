Nothing can change for the better mankind is wrestling with his own folly and in spite of any actual attempted revolution it's called denial that the games we play are played in vanity and for the advantage of a select few; pop culture has us chasing ghosts floating from one trend to the next.

The lie in between is a true statement and its further development into a manifestation of said truth in any logical discourse which should of course be the norm anytime your judgment may fall harshly upon another conscious being let you create a victim to your own ideological preferences this is a type of evil because as anyone who is even slightly open to the force of good in the world will find out there's always more reality than just your own narrow scope of truths not to say they are necessarily wrong in their thoughts but in the dismissal of infinitesimal other perspectives the individual may lose sight of greater prospects.

> Exodus 19:3-4
>
> And Moses went up unto God, and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself

Sometimes life can make you feel like you are flailing through the air and you can’t seem to find anything solid to hold onto, and when you finally do find something you can grab onto it might fall apart as well. It can be hard in those times to really get before the Lord and allow Him to bring you through hard times and tough days one step at a time, but it is possible.

Remember when the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they went through many hard and tough things, yet the promise was still true that God would bring them into the Promised Land. God had to remind Moses, “Don’t you remember how I bore you up on eagles’ wings and brought you out of Egypt unto me?” Even though many of their days were tough and hard, God still was watching them and mindful of them.

God will hold you up on eagle’s wings if you trust in Him. You might feel like you are flailing sometimes, but rest assured that the Lord is watching and is mindful. He is always working in your situations, even though it may not seem like He is. He is always working for the good of them that are called according to His purpose.

Let the Lord bear you up on His wings. Let the Lord bear you up in His own way. Get before Him, and keep before Him, until He moves in His way and brings comfort and peace.

#### 60-0804 - " As The Eagle Stirreth Up Her Nest”

63 She shakes those little eagles off right out in the air. She said, "All right, children, flop for yourself." Hm, my. One of them, you know, he… Now, what does she do? She swoops out to one side, sails along watching them. The first thing you know, one of these little eagles is on his back. He's a flopping as hard as he can. Next one has his face down, he's flopping as hard as he can. But she's a watching them. They don't care, they're having a pentecostal jubilee, just flopping around, they don't care. If they get topsy turvey, get out of balance, they are trusting in the great, all sufficient, power of their mother. If one of them little fellows gets out of topsy turvey, and gets turning over too fast or something, she'll swoop right under him, and pick him up, and bring him up back into the grace again. Amen. Glory.

"Let your life speak!"

> -- Quaker Saying

"You must teach your children that the ground beneath their feet is the ashes of our grandfathers. So that they will respect the land, tell your children that the earth is rich with the lives of our kin. Teach your children what we have taught our children -- that the earth is our mother. Whatever befalls the earth, befalls the sons of the earth. If men spit upon the ground, the spit upon themselves.

This we know. The earth does not belong to man; man belongs to the earth. This we know. All things are connected like the blood which unites one family. All things are connected.

Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons of the earth. Man did not weave the web of life; he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself **...**"

> -- Chief Seattle

"The landscape everywhere, away from the river, is of rock-- cliffs of rock; plateaus of rock; terraces of rock; crags of rock -- ten thousand strangely carved forms.

When speaking of these rocks, we must not conceive of piles of boulders, or heaps of fragments, but a whole land of naked rock, with giant forms carved on it: cathedral-shaped buttes, towering hundreds or thousands of feet; cliffs that cannot be scaled, and canyon walls that shink the river into insignificance, with vast hollow domes and tall pinnacles, and shafts set on the verge overhead, and all highly colored buff, gray, red, brown, and chocolate; never lichened; never moss-covered; but bare, and often polished."

> -- John Wesley Powell, 1875

"Leave it as it is. You cannot improve on it; not a bit. The ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it."

> -- Theodore Roosevelt

"Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great."

> -- Mark Twain

"Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it's time to pause and reflect."

> -- Mark Twain

"Reader, suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself."

> -- Mark Twain

"I have never let my schooling interfere with my education."

> -- Mark Twain

**Gusteau:** "You must be imaginative, strong-hearted. You must try things that may not work, and you must not let anyone define your limits because of where you come from. Your only limit is your soul. What I say is true - anyone can cook... but only the fearless can be great."

> -- From the movie: "Ratatouille"

**Gusteau:** "If you focus on what you've left behind you will never be able to see what lies ahead."

"... the Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts; the Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war; the Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order; and the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs."

> -- from the book "1984" by George Orwell

"Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past."

War is Peace  
Freedom is Slavery  
Ignorance is Strength

> -- (Party slogan) from the book "1984" by George Orwell

"Winston watched \[the proles\] disgustedly. And yet, just for a moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats! Why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered? Until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious."

> -- from the book "1984" by George Orwell

"The heresy of heresies was common sense. And what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right. For, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? Or that the force of gravity works? Or that the past is unchangable? If both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable -- what then?"

> -- from the book "1984" by George Orwell

"Truisms are true, hold on to that! The solid world exists, its laws do not change. Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported fall toward the Earth's center. With the feeling that he was speaking to O'Brien, and also that he was setting forth an important axiom, he wrote: Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two makes four. If that is granted, all else follows."

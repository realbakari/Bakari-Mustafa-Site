For a beginner learning Git, the most crucial features to understand are:

1. Repositories: A Git repository is a collection of files and their history, stored in a directory on your computer. This is the fundamental unit of organization in Git, and it is where you will track and manage your project's files and changes.
2. Commits: A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a particular point in time. When you make changes to your files, you stage those changes and then create a commit to save them to your repository's history. This allows you to track and revert changes, and it also makes it possible to collaborate with others on a project.
3. Branches: A branch is a separate line of development in a Git repository. By default, Git creates a master branch when you create a repository, but you can also create additional branches for experimenting with new ideas or working on different features. You can switch between branches to manage your project's development, and you can merge branches to combine their changes.
4. Pull requests: When you are working on a project with other people, you can use pull requests to review and merge changes from other branches into your own. This allows you to collaborate on a project and manage changes in a structured way.

  
Here is a list of the most crucial features for a beginner to learn about Git, with a sublist of related workflows and commands for each feature:

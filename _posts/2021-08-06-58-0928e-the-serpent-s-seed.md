Here is what most people think happened in the Garden of Eden: God told Adam and Eve not to eat a certain fruit. The serpent “beguiled” Eve into eating the fruit. Then Eve gave it to Adam, and he did the same, which caused them to know they were naked and led to the fall of the human race. The obvious questions are: what kind of a snake can talk, why did eating fruit open their eyes to their nakedness, and why do they immediately have children after this? The answer is simple, and this sermon explains it.

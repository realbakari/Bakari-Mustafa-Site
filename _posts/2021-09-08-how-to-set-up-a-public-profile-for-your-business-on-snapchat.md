### Why Use Snapchat Public Profiles?

Snapchat launched public profiles in mid-2020, but until recently, only verified creators could access this feature. As of June 2021, all Snapchatters can create public profiles and leverage the many promotional opportunities they offer.

Essentially, a public profile is your business’s home on Snapchat. Snapchatters can find it through search, on the Discovery tab, via lenses, or through a paid ad. They can also access it directly from a snapcode or shareable URL.

#### Public profiles come with these elements:

* **Short bio**: Like many other social media platforms, Snapchat gives you up to 150 characters to introduce your brand and tell subscribers what you’re all about.
* **Location**: If your business serves a local clientele, you can select a city and state to help customers identify you.
* **Business type**: Choose from dozens of business categories ranging from brand to entrepreneur to non-profit organization.
* **Subscribe button**: Rather than adding your business as a friend, Snapchat Users can subscribe to your public profile content.
* **Subscribers**: As your business gains subscribers, the total count appears in your public profile. Subscribers are separate from any friends your brand’s account may have.
* **Verified status**: If your brand is verified, a yellow check mark shows next to your business name, confirming that your public profile is an official page.
* **Website link**: If you’d like subscribers to visit an external website, add your brand’s URL.

#### Snapchat public profiles also feature up to four types of content:

* **Public story**: Automatically show any stories your business has published within the past 24 hours.
* **Highlights**: Display curated collections of your favorite stories, photos, videos, and public snaps.
* **Lenses**: Showcase the lenses you’ve developed.
* **Shop**: Allow Snapchatters to experience your eCommerce store.

# How to Create or Switch to a Snapchat Public Profile

You can set up a Snapchat public profile in just a few minutes. If you’re ready to design lenses, create highlights, set up your shop, and add members, plan on spending at least an hour.

* Set up a Business Account by logging into [Business Manager](https://business.snapchat.com/) and selecting ‘Public Profiles’. To create a free business account, you can find more information [here](https://forbusiness.snapchat.com/advertising/getting-started).
* Create a free Public Profile by setting up a username (or connect an existing one), and add business information to the Profile. Then click _‘Update Profile’_ to make your Profile live and searchable.
* Add content like Lenses, Stories, and Highlights to the Public Profile from the Snapchat app.
* All users are now able to find, engage with, and subscribe to the Public Profile.

## Conclusion

If your target audience includes typical Snapchat user demographics, creating a public profile is likely to be a smart choice for your business. Although you certainly don’t have to leverage all of the features, at the least, Snapchat recommends posting snaps or stories a few times a week to keep your audience engaged.

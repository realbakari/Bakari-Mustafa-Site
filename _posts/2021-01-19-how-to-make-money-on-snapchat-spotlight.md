To attract more creators, Snapchat is promising users a cut of $1 million for creating the best clips.

### It Pays to Be in the Spotlight

A post on the [**Snap Newsroom**](https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/) unveiled Spotlight, Snapchat's attempt at one-upping TikTok. The Spotlight tab is a place where Snapchat can "shine a light on the most entertaining Snaps created by the Snapchat community."

You’ll see a dedicated tab called the Snapchat spotlight in the app itself. As a user, you have the opportunity to submit your best video Snaps to earn a share of 1 million dollars. Snapchat said in a public statement that it’ll be paying a share of this amount on a daily basis for best performing video Snaps.

### How does Spotlight work?

Spotlight looks to be close to the format of TikTok and Instagram’s Reels and is set to work similarly. But the plan for rewarding the best content is likely to attract and encourage a surge of attention and engagement with the new feature.

### Here’s how it works:

* Spotlight videos can be accessed to the right of the bottom navigation bar on Snapchat
* Users upload Snap videos the same way they would upload snaps to send to their friends or story, by selecting to send to ‘Spotlight’
* Videos can be up to 60 seconds long, and anyone over the age of 13 can upload them, but users must be 16 or older to make money
* Users can add text, filters, GIF, Topics (Hashtags), and music to customise their videos
* The Spotlight section of the Snapchat App will feed users content based on algorithms of their past history and interaction
* Uploads cannot be watermarked, meaning people cannot upload their viral videos from TikTok or Instagram’s Reels
* Spotlight videos currently do not have comment sections, and Snapchat will moderate video content to maintain its community guidelines
* Accounts on Spotlight will be private by default
* Users can share their spotlight videos with other Snap contacts and as links on other platforms

The platform will only display the creator's username if their Snapchat profile is public. This might be a little strange at first, especially if you're used to following your favorite creators on TikTok and Instagram.

### TikTok Faces More Competition

Snapchat isn't the only platform that's been gaining inspiration from TikTok. Instagram has already followed in TikTok's footsteps by creating Reels, a section specifically for short-form videos.

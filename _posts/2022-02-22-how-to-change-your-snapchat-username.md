After years of users asking Snapchat for this particular feature, the social media company has finally given in.

Snapchat is letting users change one of the most important elements of any social media profile—their usernames.

Snapchat is allowing you to you change your username. Previously, you could only **change your Snapchat display name**, but never your username.

If you wanted to have a different username on Snapchat, your only option was to delete your account entirely and start a new one.

Changing your Snapchat username is a simple process. Follow the simple steps below:

1. Tap ⚙️ in My Profile to open **Settings**
2. Tap ‘**Username**’ under the ‘My Account’ section
3. Tap ‘**Change Username**’
4. **Enter your new username**, then tap ‘Next’
5. **Enter your password** to confirm your username change, then tap ‘Confirm’

That's it, your new username for the next year is saved.

**Note**: You can change your Snapchat username once a year.

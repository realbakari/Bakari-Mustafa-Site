I write because I read. This is a list of book that covers a broad range of insight and ideas. some of these have a big impact on how I think, but there are some other valuable reads that I have left out. it’s fun to look back at what you’ve accomplished this year.

For this year’s Book recommendation list, I choose five titles I think you’ll enjoy reading. if you only have to read one or two books, I highly recommend you pick on the below list - They are listed in no particular order.

1. [Man’s Search For Meaning](https://www.amazon.com.au/Mans-Search-Meaning-Viktor-Frankl/dp/080701429X): In Man’s Search for Meaning, psychologist Victor Frankl draws on his experiences in Auschwitz to develop his method of logotherapy. In the concentration camp, he discovered that the desire to find meaning is essential to the human experience. He uses this knowledge in his psychoanalytic practice
2. [Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion by Robert Cialdini, Ph.D.](https://amzn.to/2vrUsGh): The book talks about various psychological tactics used by compliance practitioners like salespeople, waiters, car dealers, and fundraisers to influence us into saying yes to something to which ideally we would have said no. [Influence](https://amzn.to/2vrUsGh) explains the psychology of why people say “yes”—and how to apply these understandings, [Influence: The Psychology of Persuasio](https://amzn.to/2vrUsGh)n will help you gain a better understanding of the human mind and human behavior.
3. [The Crucible of Doubt: Reflections On the Quest for Faith](https://www.amazon.com/Crucible-Doubt-Reflections-Quest-Faith/dp/1609079426): The Crucible of Doubt: Reflections on the Quest for Faith by Terryl and Fiona Givens is a thoughtful, honest, and provocative book less about exploring the darkness of doubt and more about finding peace of mind in a world of uncertainties. Its most valuable contribution comes from returning to the foundation of Mormon theology: that all truth can be circumscribed into one great whole, and that truth is to be learned “by study and also by faith.”
4. [Brave New World by Aldous Huxley](https://www.amazon.com/Brave-New-World-Revisited/dp/0060776099/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1WGK9EKW4MPIR&keywords=brave+new+world&qid=1576305160&s=books&sprefix=brave+%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C421&sr=1-2): The novel is an example of dystopian fiction, a story in which a society’s attempt to create a perfect world goes wrong. The society in question is set in a futuristic version of London where the government has tried to create a completely stable civilization, one where the people are always happy. Unfortunately, the government has done this by conditioning people to focus solely on physical pleasure. On the surface, this might seem like a great idea, but in his dystopian novel, [Brave New World](https://www.amazon.com/Brave-New-World-Revisited/dp/0060776099/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1WGK9EKW4MPIR&keywords=brave+new+world&qid=1576305160&s=books&sprefix=brave+%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C421&sr=1-2) Aldous Huxley shows how dangerous it can be to let the government regulate happiness.
5. [Your Brain Is a Time Machine: The Neuroscience and Physics of Time by Dean](https://www.amazon.com/Your-Brain-Time-Machine-Neuroscience/dp/0393247945/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=raggwrit-20&linkId=ca9bc2d4f665460189031d05ff1a2e2d): Buonomano Buonomano’s book Your Brain Is a Time Machine is full of delicious details about the myriad ways in which cells – neurons and other types – tell the time. Divided into two parts, the book first explains the neuroscience behind the brain’s capacity to keep and tell time. The second part goes into physical theories of time and attempts to show how time is both a mental construct and dimension.

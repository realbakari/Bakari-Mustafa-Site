“Life isn’t about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.”

George Bernard Shaw said that. It’s profound. Tim Ferriss also said, “You don’t necessarily find yourself, you create yourself one little step at a time.”

Don’t invest in a career. Build a life. You don’t have to but should you decide to accept a wrong role just because you need it, think about how long you will have to endure the pain of doing what you really don’t want!

There is always a much better way to manage a round hole if you are a square peg. If you can’t find what you want, create it.

**Showing up is not sufficient. Make an impact.**

Take every opportunity to show up but reset expectations.

Leave a mark. Show your most amazing work.

Make a bold challenge to pursue what you really want.

**Don’t expect total acceptance of your ideas, prepare to be pushed, but don’t fall.**

“Be yourself- not your idea of what you think somebody else’s idea of yourself should be,” says Henry David Thoreau.

There will always be rules and limitations, but guess what limits can be stretched.

What can you improve this year? What can you do better in business and career? Ask the right questions about why the rules exist, but not just any question.

**You may have been asking the wrong questions all this while.**

Can you create your own path? Yes, you can!

You think you are not capable but you can do more than you think you can.

Don’t trust the system to take care of you.

Create your own system or rules and find a way to make it work. Stick to the bigger picture but be prepared to embrace change along the way.

Following instructions is no longer sufficient for your success.

Don’t fear to stumble.

The important thing about any journey is the courage to get back up and continue.

There are countless stories about entrepreneurs who failed multiple times but still pursued their dreams in the midst of the stumbling blocks.

What is stopping you from trying out one of the many ideas in your notepad? Don’t fear to fail, if you are failing, fail fast and move on but whatever happens, don’t give up on the bigger dream.

The path could change but the vision should be clear throughout the journey.

Don’t give in to the relentless pressure to get a job if you really want to create or start something on your own.

What can you do next or better still what are you going to do next! It’s about time you made your first innovative step.

Take that bold step now!

You don’t have to be right, you just need to start.

Fear is only as deep as the mind allows. — Japanese Proverb

Thoughts like “nobody will like it” “my friends will think I am crazy” can deter you from making any step into who you actually are or what you can accomplish.

Put your mind to getting things done instead of focusing on all the things that could go wrong.

> Don’t escape from fear; embrace your deepest fear and fight it to overcome it!

Almost everyone can sprint. The road to mastery requires consistency. Everything meaningful in life is a marathon.

Give yourself permission to think and act. Choose to do your most amazing work without anyone’s approval. Choose yourself today!

You’ll suck at most things in the beginning. It takes time, persistence, and patience to create anything worthwhile. Keep on trying.

Keep doing what you love, even if no one buys it, sponsors it, or shares it. It matters that you show up. The magic will eventually happen!

“Don’t dare to be different, dare to be yourself — if that doesn’t make you different then something is wrong,” says Laura Baker

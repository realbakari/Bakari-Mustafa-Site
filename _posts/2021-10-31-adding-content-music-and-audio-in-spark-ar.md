There are multiple ways in which you can use audio in your AR project through Spark AR. An introduction to the use of audio in Spark AR can be found [**here**](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/learn/documentation/docs/audio/).

### Adding an Audio file

It is important to note that Spark AR only supports M4A file format. You can convert audio files to M4A using open source software like [**Audacity**](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/). A tutorial for this can be found [**here**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5rw9Ypo7dY).

1. Click on Add Asset in the Assets pane.
2. Click on Import from Computer.
3. Select the file you want to open and click Open.
